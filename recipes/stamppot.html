    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Now here's a twist on your mashed potatoes! This national
        dish of the Netherlands is a comfort food that I am glad to
        have in my life
    </p>

    <p>
        It is a simple and humble dish, where potatoes are mashed
        with other veggies and topped with smoked sausage. But
        somehow this flavor combination works perfectly.
