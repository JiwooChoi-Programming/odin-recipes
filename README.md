# odin-recipes

I made this recipes page where you start with a list of food that you want to see the recipe from. Once you click on one of the food in the lists, you can see recipes of the food that you selected.

This project uses HTML and plays around with CSS.

I learned that you need to have fun sometimes with these kinds of mini projects instead of thinking about building a huge project right away.
